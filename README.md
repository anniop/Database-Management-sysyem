# 📚 SQL & DBMS Placement Notes

Welcome to my SQL and DBMS notes repository — a **comprehensive, beginner-friendly, and interview-oriented** collection of everything you need to crack placement questions on databases and structured query language (SQL).

> 📌 Built using my own practice database so that I can *learn-by-doing* and also revisit these concepts easily.

## 🏗️ Practice Database Schema

I’ve created my own `EmployeesDB` to practice queries hands-on.
### 👨‍💼 Employees Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT,
    hire_date DATE
);
```
➡️ More tables like Departments, Projects will be added as we explore JOINS.
