## üíº Interview Tips
- Know the difference between `=` and `IN`
- Use `BETWEEN` instead of combining `>=` and `<=`
- `LIKE` is mostly used with `%`(wildcards):
	- `%a` -> ends with a
	- `a%` -> starts with a
	- `%a%` -> contains a
	- `__a` -> 3-letter word ending in `a`
- `NULL` is never compared with `=`, always use `IS NULL`
